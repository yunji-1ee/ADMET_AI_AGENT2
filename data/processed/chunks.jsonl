{"page": 1, "section": "INTRODUCTION", "subsection": null, "content": "INTRODUCTION\nIn the intestine, a single layer of epithelial cells covers the\ninner intestinal wall and forms the rate-limiting barrier to the\nabsorption of dissolved drugs. As a consequence, the proper\nreconstitution of a human differentiated epithelial cell monolayer in vitro allows the prediction of oral drug absorption in\nhumans1. The human colon carcinoma cell line Caco-2 has been\nfound to serve this purpose well. In culture, this cell line slowly\ndifferentiates into monolayers with a differentiated phenotype with\nmany functions of the small intestinal villus epithelium. Caco-2\ncells grown on permeable ﬁlters (Fig. 1) have, therefore, become the\ngolden standard for in vitro prediction of intestinal drug permeability and absorption2. The most common application of this\ncell line can be seen in Figure 2a. In this ﬁgure, the permeability\nof Caco-2 monolayers to a series of orally administered,\npassively transported drugs is plotted as a function of the absorbed\nfraction of these drugs after oral administration in humans.\nOnce this curve has been established in a research laboratory, the\nin vitro permeability of a new compound in Caco-2 cells can\nbe used to predict the absorption in humans, provided that\nconfounding factors such as the drug solubility and metabolism\ncan be accounted for with the help of other assays3. The Food and\nDrug Administration provides a list of reference drugs that can\nbe used to establish a curve corresponding to that presented\nin Figure 2a4.\nCaco-2 cell monolayers are also used to elucidate drug transport\nmechanisms, as many of the brush border enzymes and transport\nproteins that mediate the active uptake or efﬂux of drugs in the\nintestine are functional in Caco-2 cells. An example of such a study\nis given in Figure 2b, where the absorption mechanism of a\nrepresentative of a new class of anti-HIV compounds was determined. In this example, it was shown that the compound was\ndegraded by the brush border peptidase CD26 to one active and\none inactive compound and that the two resulting compounds\nwere transported across Caco-2 cells by different mechanisms5. In\nthis context, it should be noted that Caco-2 cells do not express all\nimportant intestinal drug-metabolizing enzymes, such as CYP3A4,\nto an appreciable extent, although this enzyme can be induced by\ndihydroxy-vitamin D36,7.\nIf carefully controlled, the Caco-2 cell monolayers can perform\nconsistently within a single laboratory for decades. However, the\npolyclonal Caco-2 cell line is rather unstable, and, without good\nquality control, it may alter its performance over time and with the\npassage number. Below, we present our protocol for the cultivation\nand evaluation of Caco-2 cell monolayers grown on permeable\nsupports, followed by our procedures for the assessment of drug\ntoxicity, drug permeability and active drug transport across Caco-2\nmonolayers. It should be noted that, depending on the compounds\nto be studied, variants of the protocols may be necessary. For\ninstance, if compounds of low solubility are to be studied, the\ninclusion of solubility-enhancing agents, such as serum albumin,\nmay be necessary8. The protocols are based on 20 years of\nexperience and have, without any dramatic alterations, resulted\nin the consistent performance of Caco-2 cell monolayers in drug\ntransport studies in our laboratory over this period of time.\nOverview of the procedure\nThe experimental procedure is comprised of two parts, the cultivation of the Caco-2 cells on ﬁlter supports (Steps 1–11) and the drug\ntransport experiment (Steps 12–20).

TROUBLESHOOTING\nFor each batch of seeded cells, a quantitative integrity control of the monolayers by performing a transport experiment with a hydrophilic\nparacellular marker is also recommended.

{"page": 4, "section": "BOX 4 |", "subsection": null, "content": "BOX 4 | STUDYING ACTIVE TRANSPORT\nMany researchers, including us, prefer to perform transport experiments in both directions across the cell monolayers. The ratio between the two\npermeability coefﬁcients obtained, which is usually named the efﬂux ratio or the uptake ratio, can then be used as a ﬁrst indication of the\ninvolvement of an active transport process. We recommend the following:\n1. A low concentration, typically in the low micromolar range, is used to avoid saturation of the transporter.\n2. Perform a transport experiment as in Box 2.\n3. Perform a transport experiment as in Box 2, but with the compound being added to the basolateral compartment instead of the apical side\nand with the samples being taken from the apical side.\n4. Calculate the permeability coefﬁcients.\n5. If there is a signiﬁcant difference between the permeability coefﬁcients in the two directions, as shown by, for example, an efﬂux ratio of\n1.5–2.0, then a transport experiment with increasing donor concentrations should be performed to investigate if the ﬂux rate is\nconcentration-dependent and if the transport is saturable. Traditionally, kinetic parameters such as KM and Vmax have been derived from such\nexperiments. Such kinetic parameters should be considered as apparent parameters, as in Caco-2 cells several transport proteins may\ncontribute to the net ﬂux of the compound. Moreover, in the case of ABC transporters, which pick up substrates from the cell membrane, the\ncontribution of membrane partitioning may be signiﬁcant22–25.\n6. If there is no clear difference between the permeability coefﬁcients in the two directions, the transport might be passive. Alternatively, the\ntransport protein could depend on a proton gradient, or the transport protein is not expressed in the Caco-2 monolayers. Examples of\nintestinal transport proteins that are dependent on a proton gradient are the peptide transporter PEPT1 (SLC15A1)26 and the organic anion\ntransporter OATP-B (SLCO2B1)27. For these transporters, a more acidic pH in the apical chamber is recommended to create the proton\ngradient. When performing transport experiments in the presence of a pH gradient, the proportions of unionized and ionized species of a\ncharged compound will differ with pH. For passively permeating compounds, this will lead to different permeabilities in the two transport\ndirections, as only the uncharged fraction will permeate the cell membrane9,10. Therefore, the contribution of a proton-dependent transporter\non the transport might be examined by inhibition experiments.\n7. As an alternative, inhibitors of the transport proteins can be used. The inhibitor concentration should be kept constant during the entire\nexperiment. It is also advisable to preincubate the Caco-2 monolayers with the inhibitor during the wash period. Ideally, speciﬁc inhibitors\nshould be used to inhibit the transport process. However, there are only a few speciﬁc inhibitors. In the screening situation, a rather\nnonspeciﬁc inhibitor is sometimes preferred to obtain broad simultaneous inhibition of several efﬂux transporters.

Incubate the (lid-covered) plate with the ﬁlter supports in the incubator at 37 1C on a calibrated orbital shaker at\n500 r.p.m. to minimize the impact of the unstirred water layer.\nm CRITICAL STEP It has been shown that the permeability of highly permeable compounds is dependent on the thickness of the\nunstirred water layer2,15. Inadequate stirring will result in underestimation of the permeability coefﬁcients for highly permeable\ncompounds (i.e., those with a permeability coefﬁcient larger than 2 \u0002 10\u00015 cm s\u00011)15,16.

Sample from the receiving compartment at appropriate time points (for the ab experiment, the basolateral compartment;\nfor the ba experiment, the apical compartment). Typically, when performing a replacement experiment, half of the volume in the\nreceiver chamber is sampled and replaced by the same volume of pre-warmed buffered HBSS.\nThe sampling is generally performed at 4–5 different time points, but in permeability screening, a single time point is often\nused for qualitative assessment. If the simplest and most commonly used expression is applied to calculate the permeability,\nsampling intervals should be chosen so that the transport experiment is completed before the receiver concentration exceeds\n10% of the donor concentration per time interval to maintain sink conditions. Sampling times will vary from 5 min for very\nrapidly transported compounds, that is, usually more lipophilic drugs, to 1 h for compounds that are transported more slowly,\nsuch as hydrophilic compounds that are dependent on the paracellular route. A detailed step-by-step example for performing\na transport experiment is given in Box 2."}
