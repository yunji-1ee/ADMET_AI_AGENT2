      "text": "Determination of drug permeability and prediction\nof drug absorption in Caco-2 monolayers\nIna Hubatsch, Eva G E Ragnarsson & Per Artursson\nDepartment of Pharmacy, Uppsala University, Box 580, SE-751 23 Uppsala, Sweden. Correspondence should be addressed to P.A. (per.artursson@farmaci.uu.se).\nPermeability coefﬁcients across monolayers of the human colon carcinoma cell line Caco-2, cultured on permeable supports, are\ncommonly used to predict the absorption of orally administered drugs and other xenobiotics. This protocol describes our method for\nthe cultivation, characterization and determination of permeability coefﬁcients of xenobiotics (which are, typically, drug-like\ncompounds) in the Caco-2 model. A few modiﬁcations that have been introduced over the years are incorporated in the protocol. The\nmethod can be used to trace the permeability of a test compound in two directions, from the apical to the basolateral side or vice\nversa, and both passive and active transport processes can be studied. The permeability assay can be completed within one working\nday, provided that the Caco-2 monolayers have been cultured and differentiated on the permeable supports 3 weeks in advance.\nINTRODUCTION\nIn the intestine, a single layer of epithelial cells covers the\ninner intestinal wall and forms the rate-limiting barrier to the\nabsorption of dissolved drugs. As a consequence, the proper\nreconstitution of a human differentiated epithelial cell monolayer in vitro allows the prediction of oral drug absorption in\nhumans1. The human colon carcinoma cell line Caco-2 has been\nfound to serve this purpose well. In culture, this cell line slowly\ndifferentiates into monolayers with a differentiated phenotype with\nmany functions of the small intestinal villus epithelium. Caco-2\ncells grown on permeable ﬁlters (Fig. 1) have, therefore, become the\ngolden standard for in vitro prediction of intestinal drug permeability and absorption2. The most common application of this\ncell line can be seen in Figure 2a. In this ﬁgure, the permeability\nof Caco-2 monolayers to a series of orally administered,\npassively transported drugs is plotted as a function of the absorbed\nfraction of these drugs after oral administration in humans.\nOnce this curve has been established in a research laboratory, the\nin vitro permeability of a new compound in Caco-2 cells can\nbe used to predict the absorption in humans, provided that\nconfounding factors such as the drug solubility and metabolism\ncan be accounted for with the help of other assays3. The Food and\nDrug Administration provides a list of reference drugs that can\nbe used to establish a curve corresponding to that presented\nin Figure 2a4.\nCaco-2 cell monolayers are also used to elucidate drug transport\nmechanisms, as many of the brush border enzymes and transport\nproteins that mediate the active uptake or efﬂux of drugs in the\nintestine are functional in Caco-2 cells. An example of such a study\nis given in Figure 2b, where the absorption mechanism of a\nrepresentative of a new class of anti-HIV compounds was determined. In this example, it was shown that the compound was\ndegraded by the brush border peptidase CD26 to one active and\none inactive compound and that the two resulting compounds\nwere transported across Caco-2 cells by different mechanisms5. In\nthis context, it should be noted that Caco-2 cells do not express all\nimportant intestinal drug-metabolizing enzymes, such as CYP3A4,\nto an appreciable extent, although this enzyme can be induced by\ndihydroxy-vitamin D36,7.\nIf carefully controlled, the Caco-2 cell monolayers can perform\nconsistently within a single laboratory for decades. However, the\npolyclonal Caco-2 cell line is rather unstable, and, without good\nquality control, it may alter its performance over time and with the\npassage number. Below, we present our protocol for the cultivation\nand evaluation of Caco-2 cell monolayers grown on permeable\nsupports, followed by our procedures for the assessment of drug\ntoxicity, drug permeability and active drug transport across Caco-2\nmonolayers. It should be noted that, depending on the compounds\nto be studied, variants of the protocols may be necessary. For\ninstance, if compounds of low solubility are to be studied, the\ninclusion of solubility-enhancing agents, such as serum albumin,\nmay be necessary8. The protocols are based on 20 years of\nexperience and have, without any dramatic alterations, resulted\nin the consistent performance of Caco-2 cell monolayers in drug\ntransport studies in our laboratory over this period of time.\nOverview of the procedure\nThe experimental procedure is comprised of two parts, the cultivation of the Caco-2 cells on ﬁlter supports (Steps 1–11) and the drug\ntransport experiment (Steps 12–20). Procedures for appropriate\ncontrols of the monolayer integrity are given in Box 1 and in the\nREAGENT SETUP section. Box 2 describes procedure for determining paracellular permeability to [14C]mannitol. Box 3 contains\nnotes concerning the sampling options.

In addition, controls should be made when larger changes in the culture conditions, for example, a new batch of serum, are\nintroduced. The morphology is preferably evaluated by confocal microscopy. Usually, a single stain with rhodamine-phalloidin (to visualize\nactin)17 is sufﬁcient to ensure that a single layer of cells is present. Alternatively, immunohistochemical staining of the tight junction proteins\nZO-1 or ﬂuorescent nuclear stains can be used17 (see Fig. 3b,c). ? TROUBLESHOOTING\nFor each batch of seeded cells, a quantitative integrity control of the monolayers by performing a transport experiment with a hydrophilic\nparacellular marker is also recommended. We routinely use [14C]mannitol for this purpose. The control can be done on separate monolayers (see\nBox 2) or in parallel with the compound to be tested in the transport experiment. In the latter case, note that all samples will be radioactive\nbecause of the paracellular marker [14C]mannitol. The ﬂuorescent compound lucifer yellow is regarded as a non-radioactive alternative to\nevaluate monolayer integrity, but higher donor concentrations are required for detection to be possible20,21.\nAs a quality control of each ﬁlter, the TER is routinely measured before the start of transport experiments (after replacing the cell culture\nmedium with HBSS at the end of the washing step) using the Endohm tissue resistance measurement chamber (at 37 1C). In addition, the TER is\nmeasured at the end of the transport experiment. When establishing the technique of culturing Caco-2 cells on ﬁlter supports, TER might be\ncontrolled at different days during the maintenance period to follow the monolayer development.\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n–8\n–7\nlog Papp (cm s–1)\nGPG-amide\nG-amide\nGP\nPepT1\nCD 26\n–5\n–6\n–4\n–3\nFA (%)\na\nb\nFigure 2 | Application of the technique in absorption and drug metabolism\nstudies.

Adjust the pH to 7.4 and sterile-ﬁlter the solution. If a pH of\n6.5 is desired, use 10 mM methanesulfonic acid instead of HEPES. m CRITICAL\nWhether a pH of 6.5 or 7.4 is used on the apical side depends on the type\nof transport study. In the standard setting, we recommend that a pH of 7.4\nis applied on both sides of the monolayer, as this allows direct comparison of the\npermeabilities in both directions without a need to consider pH-dependent\neffects on the charge of the ionizable compounds generally studied9,10.

The pH of the donor solution should be checked and, if\nnecessary, adjusted.

As only a part of the transported amount of the substance is sampled, the concentration in the receiver\ncompartment will rise during each sampling interval (even if the time intervals chosen are the same). Care must be taken that the receiver\nconcentration does not exceed 10% of the donor concentration per time interval to maintain the ‘sink’ of the receiver.\nTo avoid impaired ‘sink conditions’ for very rapidly transported substances (Papp 4 10\u00014 cm s\u00011),‘transfer experiments’ are required (possible\nfor experiments in the ab direction). In this case, a receiver plate is prepared, which contains HBSS (measured volume, here 1.2 ml) for each\nﬁlter in as many wells as there are sampling time points plus one. At the start of the experiment, the ﬁlter is inserted into the ﬁrst well, the\ndonor solution is added to the apical side and then the ﬁlter is moved at each point in time from one HBSS-containing well to the next. Care\nmust be taken that there is no solution transferred from one well to the next. In principle, the transfer experiments are experiments where all\nthe receiver solution is exchanged at each sampling.\nBOX 2 | DETERMINATION OF THE PARACELLULAR PERMEABILITY TO [14C]MANNITOL\nIN THE APICAL-TO-BASOLATERAL DIRECTION BY PERFORMING A REPLACEMENT\nEXPERIMENT\nTime required: up to 2 h without scintillation counting\n1.

      "text": "the compound does not affect the integrity of the cell monolayer. A toxic effect is\nrevealed as an increased permeability to the paracellular marker [14C]mannitol\nin the presence of the compound. A change in the [14C]mannitol permeability is\na more sensitive marker of integrity than measurement of TER values, which are\nmore variable in the simple commercial setup for routine use. Note that\nmannitol has a very low permeability across Caco-2 monolayers, so, if a highly\npermeable compound is studied, a small change in mannitol permeability may\nbe acceptable, although this must be judged from case to case. The procedure for\nmeasuring the (paracellular) [14C]mannitol permeability across the Caco-2\nmonolayer is laid out in Box 2. In our laboratory, an intact cell monolayer of\nCaco-2 cells typically has a [14C]mannitol permeability of 1.2 ± 0.5 \u0002 10\u00017 cm s\u00011,\nand we consider permeability coefﬁcients higher than 5 \u0002 10\u00017 cm s\u00011 to be\nindicative of compromised cell monolayers and values above 1 \u0002 10\u00016 cm s\u00011 to\ndemonstrate destroyed integrity of the cell monolayers to drug like compounds.\nNote that the measurement of the paracellular permeability will give an\nevaluation of the integrity of the monolayer but will not show whether the\ncompound affects a speciﬁc active transport process (see also REAGENTS).\nFor studies of active transport, a low donor concentration of 10 mM or less\nshould be used initially to avoid saturating the transport proteins if the analytical procedure is sensitive at this level. Care must be taken to avoid nonspeciﬁc adsorption to plastic surfaces when using very low donor concentrations.\nFor determination of passive transport, which is the dominating transport\nmechanism during the absorption of orally administered drugs, a high donor\nconcentration (in the millimolar range) can be applied. By this approach,\nactive transport proteins (if any) will be saturated, resulting in a ﬂux that is\ndominated by the passive permeability.\nPROCEDURE\nCultivation of Caco-2 cell monolayers grown on permeable supports\u0003 TIMING Start 21–29 d in advance of actual experiment\n1|\nTrypsinize Caco-2 cells from maximally (90%) conﬂuent Caco-2 cultures: remove the medium by aseptical decantation,\nrinse with PBS (15 ml per 75 cm2 ﬂask), decant PBS and add the trypsin/EDTA solution (5 ml per 75 cm2 ﬂask); rinse the cells\nand pour off the majority of the trypsin/EDTA so that only about 500 ml to 1 ml remains in the ﬂask; the remaining trypsin must\nwet the entire cell layer. Incubate the ﬂask (closed lid) at 37 1C for 6–15 min (use the shortest time possible) and check the\ndetachment of the cells from the plastic surface by mildly knocking the sidewall of the ﬂask with your palm. As soon as the cells\nare detached, immediately stop trypsinization by resuspending the cells in complete DMEM.\nm CRITICAL STEP The cells should be seeded on ﬁlter supports 21–29 d before the experiment.\n? TROUBLESHOOTING\n2|\nTransfer the cells to a test tube and allow the debris and large cell aggregates (if any) to sediment. Transfer the supernatant\nto a new test tube, take an aliquot and count the cells, for example, by counting the nuclei of permeabilized cells after DNA\nstaining with propidium iodide using a NucleoCounter.\nm CRITICAL STEP The percentage of dead cells must not exceed 5%. This is assessed by counting the total number of cells as well as\nthe number of non-viable cells. When using the NucleoCounter, non-viable cells are counted by omitting the cell permeabilization\nstep according to the manufacturer’s procedure.\nil\n/\nm\no\nc\n.\n.\nw\nw\nw\n//:\np\ntt\nh\nBOX 4 | STUDYING ACTIVE TRANSPORT\nMany researchers, including us, prefer to perform transport experiments in both directions across the cell monolayers. The ratio between the two\npermeability coefﬁcients obtained, which is usually named the efﬂux ratio or the uptake ratio, can then be used as a ﬁrst indication of the\ninvolvement of an active transport process. We recommend the following:\n1. A low concentration, typically in the low micromolar range, is used to avoid saturation of the transporter.\n2. Perform a transport experiment as in Box 2.\n3. Perform a transport experiment as in Box 2, but with the compound being added to the basolateral compartment instead of the apical side\nand with the samples being taken from the apical side.\n4. Calculate the permeability coefﬁcients.\n5. If there is a signiﬁcant difference between the permeability coefﬁcients in the two directions, as shown by, for example, an efﬂux ratio of\n1.5–2.0, then a transport experiment with increasing donor concentrations should be performed to investigate if the ﬂux rate is\nconcentration-dependent and if the transport is saturable. Traditionally, kinetic parameters such as KM and Vmax have been derived from such\nexperiments. Such kinetic parameters should be considered as apparent parameters, as in Caco-2 cells several transport proteins may\ncontribute to the net ﬂux of the compound. Moreover, in the case of ABC transporters, which pick up substrates from the cell membrane, the\ncontribution of membrane partitioning may be signiﬁcant22–25.\n6. If there is no clear difference between the permeability coefﬁcients in the two directions, the transport might be passive. Alternatively, the\ntransport protein could depend on a proton gradient, or the transport protein is not expressed in the Caco-2 monolayers. Examples of\nintestinal transport proteins that are dependent on a proton gradient are the peptide transporter PEPT1 (SLC15A1)26 and the organic anion\ntransporter OATP-B (SLCO2B1)27. For these transporters, a more acidic pH in the apical chamber is recommended to create the proton\ngradient. When performing transport experiments in the presence of a pH gradient, the proportions of unionized and ionized species of a\ncharged compound will differ with pH. For passively permeating compounds, this will lead to different permeabilities in the two transport\ndirections, as only the uncharged fraction will permeate the cell membrane9,10. Therefore, the contribution of a proton-dependent transporter\non the transport might be examined by inhibition experiments.\n7. As an alternative, inhibitors of the transport proteins can be used. The inhibitor concentration should be kept constant during the entire\nexperiment. It is also advisable to preincubate the Caco-2 monolayers with the inhibitor during the wash period. Ideally, speciﬁc inhibitors\nshould be used to inhibit the transport process. However, there are only a few speciﬁc inhibitors. In the screening situation, a rather\nnonspeciﬁc inhibitor is sometimes preferred to obtain broad simultaneous inhibition of several efﬂux transporters. This all-in-one procedure\nis useful for qualitative assessment of the contribution of active transport to permeability.\n2114 | VOL.2 NO.9 | 2007 | NATURE PROTOCOLS\nPROTOCOL"

Note that procedures relevant to the use of short-term cultures are available, but, in general, such cultures\nexpress less well-differentiated features, although, recently, clear improvements have been made13. However, further characterization of the short-term cultures is needed. It is essential for the outcome of the transport experiments that the cells form\nmonolayers, not multilayers. Therefore, when establishing this method, it is important to investigate the morphology of the cell\nmonolayer. Box 1 gives further information about appropriate ‘quality control’ experiments that should be performed.\nFinal preparations for the transport experiment\n11| Change the culture medium 12–24 h before the experiment.\nm CRITICAL STEP Longer periods without feeding before starting the experiment should be avoided because the cells may have\nconsumed the essential nutrients and adapted to a more starved phenotype.\nExperimental procedure\u0003 TIMING Up to 2 h, depending on the sampling intervals (excluding the time required to analyze\nthe samples)\n12| Prepare donor solutions (containing the compound of interest; see REAGENT SETUP); pre-warm all solutions used in\nsubsequent steps to 37 1C; pre-warm (to 37 1C) an incubator with humidiﬁed atmosphere (but without CO2, as the solutions are\nbuffered) equipped with an orbital shaker. Place a heating plate to be used during the sampling on the working bench.\n13| Wash the ﬁlter supports with the cell monolayers to remove residual medium by transferring the cell monolayers (medium\ndecanted, not aspirated) into new 12-well clusters containing buffered HBSS (1.5 ml per well) and carefully adding buffered\nHBSS (0.5 ml) to the apical side. Incubate the ﬁlter inserts under gentle shaking (IKA-Schuettler MTS4 orbital shaker 100\nr.p.m.) for 15–20 min at 37 1C.\n14| Measure the TER values using an Endohm tissue resistance measurement chamber (at 37 1C) according to the manufacturer’s\ninstructions. The TER values should also be measured after the experiment.\nm CRITICAL STEP The TER is highly dependent on the temperature14. If measured at room temperature (e.g., 25 1C) rather than\nat 37 1C, an erroneously high TER will be obtained.\nm CRITICAL STEP If chopstick electrodes are used, the background resistance will be higher. Correct the background resistance by\nsubtracting the resistance value obtained with cell-free ﬁlters from the TER of ﬁlters with Caco-2 monolayer. If an Endohm tissue\nresistance measurement chamber is used, the background is typically much lower.\n? TROUBLESHOOTING\nil\n/\nm\no\nc\n.\n.\nw\nw\nw\n//:\np\ntt\nh\nPROTOCOL"

Generally, we use ﬁnal volumes (i.e., after withdrawal of the c0-sample) of 0.4 ml apically and\n1.2 ml basolaterally for 12-mm ﬁlter supports during the transport experiment. These volumes have been chosen as they give the\nsame surface levels of the solutions in the two chambers so that no effect of hydrostatic pressure difference is obtained.\n(A) Apical-to-basolateral (ab) transport experiments\n(i) Remove the washing solutions by decanting and transfer the ﬁlter inserts into new clusters containing the basolateral HBSS.\nm CRITICAL STEP Decanting instead of aspirating the washing solution reduces the risk of compromising the monolayers.

Inadequate stirring will result in underestimation of the permeability coefﬁcients for highly permeable\ncompounds (i.e., those with a permeability coefﬁcient larger than 2 \u0002 10\u00015 cm s\u00011)15,16. Note, however, that too vigorous shaking\nwill affect the cell monolayer integrity.\n17| Sample from the receiving compartment at appropriate time points (for the ab experiment, the basolateral compartment;\nfor the ba experiment, the apical compartment). Typically, when performing a replacement experiment, half of the volume in the\nreceiver chamber is sampled and replaced by the same volume of pre-warmed buffered HBSS.\nThe sampling is generally performed at 4–5 different time points, but in permeability screening, a single time point is often\nused for qualitative assessment. If the simplest and most commonly used expression is applied to calculate the permeability,\nsampling intervals should be chosen so that the transport experiment is completed before the receiver concentration exceeds\n10% of the donor concentration per time interval to maintain sink conditions. Sampling times will vary from 5 min for very\nrapidly transported compounds, that is, usually more lipophilic drugs, to 1 h for compounds that are transported more slowly,\nsuch as hydrophilic compounds that are dependent on the paracellular route. A detailed step-by-step example for performing\na transport experiment is given in Box 2.\n18| Take a ﬁnal sample from the donor chamber for the calculation of the mass balance.\n19| Measure the TER values.\n’ PAUSE POINT Depending on the stability of the test compound, the samples may or may not be stored before quantiﬁcation.\n?

The equation gives a ‘weighted normalized cumulative amount of\nthe transported drug’, where the amount of transported drug in each time interval is weighted by the inverse average driving force\n(donor concentration for the interval). The ‘cumulative fraction transported’ is not a dimension-free ratio, but has the unit of a length\n(for derivation of the equation, see ref. 17). The variables C and V denote the concentration and volume in the donor (index D) or\nreceiver (index R), respectively.\nA general equation that does not require sink conditions can also be applied17. In this ‘non-sink’- analysis, Papp is determined\nby nonlinear curve ﬁtting of\nCRðtÞ ¼ ½M=ðVD+VRÞ\u0004+ðCR;0 \u0001 ½M=ðVD+VRÞ\u0004Þe\u0001PappAð1=VD+1=VRÞt\nwhere VD is the volume of the donor compartment, VR is the volume of the receiver compartment, A is the area of the ﬁlter, M is\nthe total amount of substance in the system, CR,0 is the concentration of the substance in the receiver compartment at the start\nof the time interval and CR(t) is the concentration of the substance at time t measured from the start of the time interval.\nThe mass balance (recovery) is deﬁned as the sum of the drug recovered from the acceptor chamber and the drug remaining\nin the donor chamber at the end of the experiment, divided by the initial donor amount. It is calculated according to\nrecovery ð%Þ ¼ ðCDðfinÞVD+SðCSðtÞVSðtÞÞ+CRðfinÞVRðfinÞÞ100=ðCDð0ÞVDð0ÞÞ\nwhere CD and CR are the concentrations on the donor (D) and receiver (R) sides of the monolayer at the start (0) or end (ﬁn) of\nthe experiment, CS(t) denotes the concentrations of the samples withdrawn at different time points, t, and V is used for each of\nthe respective volumes.\nThe mass balance should be as high as possible. A mass balance of 90% will generally give a 10% error in the calculated Papp\nvalue. According to our experience, a mass balance of 480% gives an acceptable approximation of the Papp value. A lower mass\nbalance will result in underestimation of the Papp values but can be acceptable for qualitative studies, aiming at identiﬁcation\nof highly permeable compounds. It is not advisable to use general correction terms for a low recovery, as the processes involved\nin the loss of the compound are compound-speciﬁc18 (see ? TROUBLESHOOTING section).\nThe efﬂux ratio is deﬁned as the quotient of the secretory permeability and the absorptive permeability (Papp,ba/Papp,ab).
