In addition, controls should be made when larger changes in the culture conditions, for example, a new batch of serum, are\nintroduced. The morphology is preferably evaluated by confocal microscopy. Usually, a single stain with rhodamine-phalloidin (to visualize\nactin)17 is sufﬁcient to ensure that a single layer of cells is present. Alternatively, immunohistochemical staining of the tight junction proteins\nZO-1 or ﬂuorescent nuclear stains can be used17 (see Fig. 3b,c). ? TROUBLESHOOTING\nFor each batch of seeded cells, a quantitative integrity control of the monolayers by performing a transport experiment with a hydrophilic\nparacellular marker is also recommended. We routinely use [14C]mannitol for this purpose. The control can be done on separate monolayers (see\nBox 2) or in parallel with the compound to be tested in the transport experiment. In the latter case, note that all samples will be radioactive\nbecause of the paracellular marker [14C]mannitol. The ﬂuorescent compound lucifer yellow is regarded as a non-radioactive alternative to\nevaluate monolayer integrity, but higher donor concentrations are required for detection to be possible20,21.\nAs a quality control of each ﬁlter, the TER is routinely measured before the start of transport experiments (after replacing the cell culture\nmedium with HBSS at the end of the washing step) using the Endohm tissue resistance measurement chamber (at 37 1C). In addition, the TER is\nmeasured at the end of the transport experiment. When establishing the technique of culturing Caco-2 cells on ﬁlter supports, TER might be\ncontrolled at different days during the maintenance period to follow the monolayer development.\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n–8\n–7\nlog Papp (cm s–1)\nGPG-amide\nG-amide\nGP\nPepT1\nCD 26\n–5\n–6\n–4\n–3\nFA (%)\na\nb\nFigure 2 | Application of the technique in absorption and drug metabolism\nstudies.
